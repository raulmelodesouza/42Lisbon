If an Ethernet port on a router were assigned an IP address of 21.121.54.71/15, which host address would be able to communicate with it?

(a) 166.121.177.233
(b) 95.199.103.46
(c) 21.121.241.69 "<<< Correct Answer!"
(d) 244.28.220.100
(e) 198.58.153.142
(f) 79.46.141.190
(g) 167.232.175.162

On a computer network, all devices that are connected to the same local network can talk directly with each other, 
as long as they have IP addresses that belong to the same IP network. If the computers belong to different IP networks 
then they have to communicate with each other via a router. The main purpose of a router is to be able to forward traffic 
to different destinations. Within computer networking, those destinations are different IP networks.


‚úèÔ∏è Answer: 21.121.241.69 would be able to communicate with 21.121.54.71/15.

Which of the following services use UDP?

(a) DHCP "<<< Correct Answer!"
(b) SMTP
(c) FTP
(d) HTTP
(e) All of the above

UDP:	(User Datagram Protocol) is a communication protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and 
		loss-tolerating connections between application on the internet.

DHCP:	The DHCP (Dynamc Host Confguration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of
		configuring devices on IP network. Employs a connectionless services model, using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
		it is implemented with two UDP port numbers for its operations which are the same as the BOOTP protocol. UDP port 
		number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client.

SMTP:	(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), is a mail transport protocol, and in mail every single packagt is important. 
		If you lose some package in the transmision of the message the recipient might not even receive the message and 
		they might be missing key information. TCP is more appropieate in this case because ensures that every package is delivered.

FTP:	(File Transfer Protocol) Is a way to transfer file online (between a client and server on a computer network), 
		uses the TCP protocol because the file transfer has to be correct.

HTTP:	(Hipertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used by the World Wide Web, and this protocol defines how messages are 
		formated and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to several commands. 
		Uses TCP instead of UDP because it guarantees delivery via a three-way handshake and re-transmission of lost packets.

DHCP is used for _____________

(a) Both IPv6 and IPv4  "<<< Correct Answer!"
(b) None of the mentioned
(c) IPv4
(d) IPv6

The original and most comprehensive implementation of the DHCP service is offered by the Internet System Consorttium, 
supporting IPv4 and IPv6.

DHCP is the standard way network adminstrator assign IP addresses in IPv4 networks, but eventually organizations will 
have to pick between two protocols created specifically for IPv6 as the use of this newer IP protocol grows.

‚úèÔ∏è Answer: Both IPv6 and IPv4

X------------------Question 05------------------X

How long is an IPv4 address?

(a) 64 bits
(b) 128 bits
(c) 128 bytes
(d) 32 bits "<<< Correct Answer!"

What is a IPv4?

IPv4 was the first version of IP. It was deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. Today it is most used IP version. It is used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system.

The IPc4 uses a 32-bits address scheme allowing to store 2^32 address which is more than billion addresses. Till date, is it consider the primary internet Protocol and carries 94% of the internet traffic.

What is a IPv6?

Is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. Internet Engineer Taskforce initiated it in early 1994. The design and development of that suite is now called IPv6.

This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addreess. It was aimed to reolve issues which are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address space. IPv6 also called IPng (Internet Protocol next generation)

‚úèÔ∏è Answer: 32-bits

Which of this is not true?

(a) UDP supports Broadcasting:
	UDP supports multcast, it is sutable for broadcast informaton such as in many kinds of service discovery and 
	shared information such as Precision Time Protocol and Routing Information Protocol.

(b) There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is requiered, it has to be managed by the application layer:
	UDP does not provide subsequent data to the application while it is requesting re-sending of the missing data.

(c) UDP is a datagram-oriented protocol: With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, 
	to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

(d) The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP. 
	There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.

(e) UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums: UDP provides checksums for data integrity, 
	and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram.

(f) UDP is comparatively slower than TCP "<<< Correct Answer!"
